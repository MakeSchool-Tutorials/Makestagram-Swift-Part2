There are a few last features that we did not implement as part of the tutorial:

- Providing the App with a dark color theme
- Implementing the *delete* and *flag* features
- Implementing filters for photos

These features are implemented in the completed project for this tutorial and are hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/MakeSchool/Makestagram-Swift-Solution).

If you are interested in implementing these three features, you should check out the source code!
